# MAMT
**MAMT**, Multi-Agent Multi-Trainer is a new OpenSource reinforcement learning framework designed to improve the development of new rl algorithms and environments. It can manage multi-agent environment and multiple-trainers (algorithms) synchronously. Trainers do not necessarily have to be policy learning.

MAMT has been created to support [sa1g](https://github.com/sa1g)'s Bachelor Degree thesis. It may not be futher developed after that.
